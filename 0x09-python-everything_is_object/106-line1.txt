The execution of the first line (a = "SCHL") creates one string object.
The execution of the second line (b = "SCHL") does not create a new string object. Instead, it references the existing string object created in line 1 because identical string literals are automatically interned in CPython.
After the execution of line 3 (del a), the string object pointed by a is not immediately deleted. The del statement removes the name a from the namespace, but it does not necessarily delete the object. In CPython, the object will be deleted by the garbage collector when there are no more references to it.
After the execution of line 4 (del b), similarly, the string object pointed by b is not immediately deleted. It will be deleted by the garbage collector when there are no more references to it.
The execution of the last line (c = "SCHL") creates a second string object because it is a new assignment.
Therefore:

Number of string objects created by the first line: 1 (for variable a).
Number of string objects created by the second line: 0 (for variable b).
After the execution of line 3, the string object pointed by a is not immediately deleted: No.
After the execution of line 4, the string object pointed by b is not immediately deleted: No.
Number of string objects created by the last line: 1 (for variable c).
