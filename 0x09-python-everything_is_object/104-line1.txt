The execution of the first line (a = 1024) creates one integer object with the value 1024.
The execution of the second line (b = 1024) creates a second integer object with the value 1024. This is a separate object from the one created in line 1 because integers are not cached in the same way as small integers.
After the execution of line 3 (del a), the int object pointed by a is not immediately deleted. The del statement removes the name a from the namespace, but it does not necessarily delete the object. In CPython, the object will be deleted by the garbage collector when there are no more references to it.
After the execution of line 4 (del b), similarly, the int object pointed by b is not immediately deleted. It will be deleted by the garbage collector when there are no more references to it.
The execution of the last line (c = 1024) creates a third integer object with the value 1024.
Therefore:

Number of int objects created by the first line: 1 (for variable a).
Number of int objects created by the second line: 1 (for variable b).
After the execution of line 3, the int object pointed by a is not immediately deleted: No.
After the execution of line 4, the int object pointed by b is not immediately deleted: No.
Number of int objects created by the last line: 1 (for variable c).
